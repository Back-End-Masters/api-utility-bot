# API: Utility Bot

## Summary: A chat bot that can create aliases for API requests and tie them to in-chat slash commands.

Problem Domain/Pain Point:

Getting information on niche topics for a topic-based discord can be streamlined by including the ability for users to poll an API and get the results in-chat. Settle arguments, get useful information instantly, or just spam the chat with lists of pokemon!
Features:
Commands for discord owners to create/delete aliases
eg. /create 'getAlbums' <api endpoint> <params>
/getAlbums "Michael Jackson" 
Alias storage (how do discord apps store data?)

Stretch Goals:
Full CRUD
