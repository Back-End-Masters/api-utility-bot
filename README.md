  - We will reach out on a need basis via Slack.
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Making our group an open space for expressing needs and not being judgemental towards one another even if we disagree.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - By being slow to say something is wrong and quick to ask for further explination if a suggestion doesn't make since to you initially.

## Work Plan

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will give everyone the same amount of time working on an issue unless someone volunteers to drive longer due to their ability to finish the feature faster. We will do tests and console.log portions of the code to make sure it is working properly before moving forward to a new feature and reference the project manager that we create.
- What project management tool will be used?
  - Trello.

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - 
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Through an organization.
- What is your Git flow?
  - Start each day with a group ```git pull``` and end with a group ```ACP```.
  - Create a new branch upon the completion of a feature.
  - Merge to the staging branch once a branch is closed.
  - Once we complete the project we will merge to the main branch.
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - The entire team.
  - Who merges PRs?
    - The first person who reviewed the PR.
  - How often will you merge?
    - Every time a feature is satisfied.
  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    - By speaking to everyone in the group and making sure we are all in agreement with the final version of a feature.
