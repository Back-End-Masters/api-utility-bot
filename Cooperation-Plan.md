## Conflict Plan

- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
  -  Make sure everyone is heard when they speak, if that is not do-able reach out to an instructor.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
  - Speak up as soon as it is happening in a respectful manner and ask how we can break up the things that are in that persons mind to help everyone contribute.
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - Communicate what you plan on doing, ask if everyone is comfortable with the task or if they need further practice and allow them to do so.
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
  - Checking in with that person and seeing if they are concerned about the problem domain. 
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
  - Speak out that things are not being resolved and state that the instructor will be notified, and discontinue the conversation if things are not healthy.

## Communication Plan

  - For Tiara, I will be able to communicate a little earlier in the day along with class time. 
  - For Micha and Michael class hours.
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
  - Slack 
- How often will you take breaks?
  - 15 min every hour.
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  - Re-asses scope.
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
  - Making our group an open space for expressing needs and not being judgemental towards one another even if we disagree.
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  - By being slow to say something is wrong and quick to ask for further explination if a suggestion doesn't make sense to you initially.

## Work Plan

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
  - We will give everyone the same amount of time working on an issue unless someone volunteers to drive longer due to their ability to finish the feature faster. We will do tests and console.log portions of the code to make sure it is working properly before moving forward to a new feature and reference the project manager that we create.
- What project management tool will be used?
  - Github.

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?
  - All of it.
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
  - Through an organization.
- What is your Git flow?
  - Start each day with a group ```git pull``` and end with a group ```ACP```.
  - Create a new branch upon the completion of a feature.
  - Merge to the staging branch once a branch is closed.
  - Once we complete the project we will merge to the main branch.
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR?
    - The entire team.
  - Who merges PRs?
    - The first person who reviewed the PR.
  - How often will you merge?
    - Every time a feature is satisfied.
  - How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
    - By speaking to everyone in the group and making sure we are all in agreement with the final version of a feature.
